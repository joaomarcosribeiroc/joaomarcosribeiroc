### Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am João Marcos Ribeiro, a **Computer Programmer** and the phrase, "how does this work" under the hood is what drive me and push me foward.

## Experience with computers

👨‍💻 I've in touch with programming **since 2012**. When I got started with learning **low level programming languages**, like C, C++. From there, I have taken a **deep dive into computer essentials**, actually learning some low level aspects of a computer. This interest gave me a well understanding of computer essentials, since memory management to multithreading computing and made me a better programmer over time. Today, in the software industry I've been in the position of revising other team members works, orienting the team about better practices on software development, **leading other team members in their daily programming tasks** and also developmenting microsservices, monoliths and serveless applications on cloud. I will detail more the technologies I've been in touch along the years.

## Software Quality

As I have a background education also in **business administration** field, I use to apply some important concepts for the success of **high quality software delivery**. To name a few, when applying **agile filosofy** on software development we are also forming the basis for **continuos improvement**, giving room for high quality software deliverance that can enhance over time. High quality and eficient software does not depend only on technical skills but also on managing, prioritizing and identified bottlenecks in the process.

### Languages I use to talk to computer 🤔
#### Programming Languages

| Name | Description |
|:----:|:------------|
| ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white) | This is the main programming language I use today to build applications |
| ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) | This is the programming language that I build my foundations upon. The one that helpe learning import concepts like data strucutres, object oriented aproach and data processing |
| ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white) | This is the first programming language I learned, the one that helpe learn about resource/memory managment |
| ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) | A convinient programming language built on top of C. I use to develop AWS Lambda functions in servless archtectures in bank environment |
| ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) | A browser programming language for dynamic pages but also has found a new home in backend service based on nodeJS. I have pratical experience on this language building frontend applications with Angular and mantaing ReactJS apps. Currently, I searching also opportunites to develop more frontend systens using reactjs and other frontend tecnologies. I've been many years at backend stage |
| ![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/dart-%230175C2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white) | A good and versatle programming language that I used when building mobile applications for android devices on flutter platform. I've built some apps using dart integrated with spring boot backends. I was a cool time. |

#### Scripting Languages
| Name | Description |
|:----:|:------------|
| ![Bash Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/bash_script-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white) | Language I use to talk to linux systens (and even windows) and automate repetitive daily tasks during local development like executing integrations, unit tests, lint verifications before push code to CR and later production |

### Cloud Experience ![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)

Modern and scalable applications is on cloud, this is a fact. Working for a banking company, I had the opportunity to build on AWS modern clustered applications that talk to lagacy systens like mainframe.
